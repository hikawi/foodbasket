# FoodBasket / MISE

**Centralized Discovery, Brand-level Identity**

</div>

## Overview

MISE is a specialized B2B backend and frontend suite designed for the restaurant
industry. Built as a direct competitor and a direct opposite of table-littered POS
systems, MISE treats relational restaurant data as a multi-axis stream, focusing
on spatial UI consistency and forgivefulness for users.

By the way, MISE comes for mise en place in French, or just "store" if you fancy
the Japanese meaning more. It's whatever most comfortable for you.

## Motivation

This project was created as a clone of my capstone project, but steered towards
my vision of the project, instead. Here are a few main reasons as well as differences
that led to the creation of this project.

- They don't seem to care about sources of truth. Their version of an SRS or a PRD
  is simply a list of features, or what they want to do, such as "A branch manager
  can manage menu items (add, remove, delete)".
- They are optimizing for the first minute the user uses, as long as you can master
  the tool in 5 minutes, that's good enough. I want to optimize for the user's 1000th
  minute of usage, I want them to work with the system fast instead of following
  the system step-by-step like a form-filling data spreadsheet job.
- They are thinking that data normalization should be the principle of the platform,
  regardless of user intuition. Clones are always referenced, like a branch is a
  "ref" to another, and changing the template branch changes all affected
  branches as a way to boast about automation and efficiency. For me, this is
  error-prone, and people prefer explicitness in a B2B software, I'd assume so.
- They want to use tables to represent naturally relational data, such as menus
  and items, or users and roles, while wanting to use a hierarchical layout for
  billings and data management.

And there are a lot more reasons, but that's the gist of it. The clash in philosophy
is too big to warrant fighting it out over a capstone.

## Requirements

These include libraries or binaries that are required to do any development work
at all:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Cosmtrek's Air
- Golang v1.25.5 or higher
- Sqlc
- NodeJS (via NVM or NPM is fine)
- GoTask (aka Taskfile)

> The following instructions are generated by an LLM.

MacOS (via Homebrew):

```bash
brew install golang node go-task/tap/go-task sqlc

go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

Debian-based (via APT):

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/task/task/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt install task

go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

Windows:

```bash
# Using Scoop (Recommended for Gophers)
scoop install go nodejs-lts task sqlc air

# Using Winget
winget install GoLang.Go.1.25
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
winget install go-task.task
```

Other platforms, go into each software's instructions to install. I can't go
that deep.
